# StickNotes-App
A  Web app for taking notes.

Hi There Folks !!
I am Saurish Kar and this is a small project of creating text only notes web app.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER !! 

This is only a Front End App that does not use any database queries or concepts to store user data on backend.
The data that has been fed stays as long as the browser session is open. Once the session is refreshed, the app gets back to starting point and all the content is gone !!


A few points to note :::

1) This is a Front-End portion of the app that lets you create, modify and delete your notes.

2) It has been developed under Vue.js framework.

3) You can directly modify your notes by typing inside it, it auto-updates the note, hence no save button.

4) To Add a New Note, click on the "+" Circle on the top right corner.

5) Please make sure that the .js and .css files are in the same location as the index.html while you download and extract the files.

6) Supported for Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, IE. Also supported for mobile devices.
