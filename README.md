# StickNotes-App
A  Web app for creatng and storing text notes

Hi There Folks !!
I am Saurish Kar and this is a small project of creating text only notes web app.

This is a simple prototype which does not use any database concepts as of now for storing.
That means the notes you create will only be present as long as the browser session remains open.

Once the browser window is closed or refreshed the interface is back to square one.

This is just to ensure the working and methodology of the web app.

This app has been developed under the Vue.js framework.

So Let's get started !!
